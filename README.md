# discord bot

Why am i even doing this

## shitty features

  - `/hello` - Says hello u dum dum dummy
  - `/roll <min> <max>` - rolls you a kebab from idk what to idk where
  - `/userinfo <usr>` - Doxxes you
  - `/warn <user> [arg]` - gives a kick in the ass

-    handlers:
  - `on_member_join` - Welcomes you and offers you a hot steamy gay sex
  - `on_message_delete` - Logs and reports like a true 60

## additional useless shit

- it does fuckin track the warns so you can give someone a warn and then give them another warn and then give them another warn and then give them another warn and then give them another warn and then give them another warn and then give them another warn and the bot will be like "hey you have 9 warns" and you'll be like "oh yeah i forgot about those"

## setup

1. Clone the shitty repo

2. Make an `.env` file with the following content:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN= insert your token like a bitch here. good boy :3
```

DO NOT POST THE REPO WITH OUR TOKEN IN IT YOU DUMBASS

3. install dependencies:

```
pip install -U discord.py python-dotenv
```

4. Run the bot:

```
python discordbot.py
```

## usage

- Invite the bot to your server with appropriate permissions ( `applications.commands` and `members` intent).

- Use the slash commands in your server

- Make sure you have channels named `powitania` and `logi` or you gonna find out the hard way

## notes

- The warn system stores warnings in mem , so it will reset when the bot restarts glhf

- The bot needs `members` intent enabled in the Discord Developer Portal aka Admin Fascist Developer Portal
